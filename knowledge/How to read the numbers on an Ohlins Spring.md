Let’s take into consideration a spring that has the following printing into it:

**==01092-24 / 80 L2218==**

To begin with there are four sets of numbers that provide information. The first set of numbers “01092” reference the series of the spring. The series is the actual nominal dimension that this spring is designed and manufactured. In this example a “01092” series spring is mate to a 57mm Inner Diameter (ID) and has a free lenght of 170mm. Besides using this number to order the corret spring that fits the shock you have, you can also use this series info to determine how much preload is currently on this spring. 
Your “suspension guy” will want to know this preload number when determining the correct setup for you.

### Preload Details.
To find the preload on your spring top out the rear suspension. Meaning lift the rear wheel off the ground with the swingarm in full extension. After that has been done, measure how long the spring is as mounted in your shock. This measurement is your “Set Lenght”. Let’s say you measured the spring in your shock at 158mm.
Using the free lenght of the spring series in the above example, you can subtract your Set Lenght from the Free Lenght, which means 170mm - 158mm = 12mm.

Back again on the serial number, the second number on the code printed on the spring is “-24”. This number represents a part number code designed to the spring rate this spring has manufactured. In this example, the number 24 is the code designation that Ohlins uses for a 80 Newton (N) spring rate. Ohlins also prints this rate directly on to the spring so you don’t really need to know the code conversion. 
The actual rate is found right after the code designation 24 and is printed after the forward slash "/".

In the code shown above, this spring has an “80” spring rate.
Below are the codes for the most common spring rates used on Ohlins shocks:
24 = 80N ; 26 = 85N ; 29 = 90N ; 31 = 95N ; 34 = 100N ; 36 = 105N ; 39 = 110N ; 41 = 115N

The last number on this spring we have not talked about yet is the portion printed at the end “L2281”. This describes a lot number.
This lot number is a code back to Ohlins, or any other manufacture that uses them, of when, what materials and methods have been used to create this part. 

With this, if Ohlins had a problem with a couple of springs form the same Lot Number the management in Sweden could go back and check the materials used to manufacture the springs from that specific lot number. 
They would then investigate why they are having issues with these springs and take corrective actions and/or make changes to manufacturing or supply to make their products better.
