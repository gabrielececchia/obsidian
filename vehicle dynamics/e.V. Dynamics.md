“Driving a car as fast as possible (in a race) is all about maintaining the highest possible acceleration level in the appropriate direction”

The overall technical objective in racing is the achievement of a vehicle configuration, acceptable within the practical interpretation of the rules, which can traverse a given course in a minimum time when operated manually by a driver utilizing techniques within his/her capabilities.

<u>Note</u>: The point to be emphasized is that to maintain a curved path on the ground the vehicle must be moving sideways as well as forward, and lateral acceleration is merely the change in lateral speed with time to achieve this.

# Tire Behaviour
Tires are the primary source of the forces and torques which provide the control and stability (or handling) of the vehicle.
_The area of the thread of a tire that is in contact with the ground at any given moment is called the print or footprint.

## Lateral Force
A lateral tire force generates at the “center” of the tire contact with the road, lies in the horizontal road plane and is perpendicular to the direction in which the wheel is headed if no inclination of camber exists.

<u>Note</u>: A vehicle turns because of the applied lateral tire forces.

### The Model Tire
The tire used in the model is made by sandwiching a sheet of hard rubber between two metal disks. The only item that is varied over a set of these tires is the diameter of the metal disks; the rubber composition, thickness and diameter of the rubber are kept constant.

![](model_tire.jpg)

*The First Experiment - Static Lateral Stiffness and Sliding*
If the tire gets pressed lightly on a table with constant vertical force, we can see that the tire gradually acts like a sping; the sidewalls bend elasically, and the lateral distortion increases in proportion to the lateral force the tire has to withstain.
After the tire began sliding, lateral force remained approximately constant.

The lateral stiffness is given as a lateral spring rate, say, in pounds per inch of deflection or kilos per millimeters of deflection. The force required to slide the tire is a function of the friction coefficient, $\mu$, which is defined as the ratio of two forces, the lateral force divided by the vertical force (the load on the tire). This is a constant over a range of loads for the model tire.

![](mechanism_of_a_tire_lateral_force_in_elastic_range.jpg)

*The Second Experiment - Rolling at Small Slip Angles*
If the model tire is deflected laterally and then rolled along, it moves in a direction at an angle to the wheel plane or heading, this is called the **Slip Angle**.

As the wheel is rolled forward without steering it will be observed that the path of the wheel is at an angle, $\alpha$, to the wheel plane.

### High Slip Angles
If the lateral force is increased, the slip angle will increase, the tire will be distorted further.
This shows that the process is progressive. When the tire has enough applied lateral force tat most of the print is sliding, it is said to have “*broken away*” and _the lateral force is determined by the coefficient of friction.

### Slip Angle Clarified
It is important to understand that there is no sliding in the print except near the trailing edge, where the vertical forces are low. The ability of the tire to travel out of its plane without appreciable slippage is the result of laying down successive prints, each laterally displaced bacause of the sideways tire distortion. It is, in other words, equivalent to heading in a given direction but walking at an angle to that direction by displacing each foot laterally as it is put on the ground.

### Relationship between lateral force and slip angle
The lateral (or cornering) force may be thought of as the result of slip angle, **or** the slip angle as the result of lateral force. Some examples:

* If the front wheels of a vehicle are steered, a slip angle is created which gives rise to a lateral force, this lateral force then turns (or *yaws*) the vehicle.
* When cornering (centrifugal force) on a banked road (gravitational force component), the lateral force is reacted by changes in tire slip angles and resultant tire forces.

In dry conditions, race tires generally reach their peak lateral force at slip angles in the vicinity of 3° - 7°. On a wet surface the peak will in general be lower, and the fall-off in lateral force after the peak will be more rapid.

## Aligning torque and pneumatic trail
Aligning torque (or moment) describes a tire’s tendency to steer about a vertical axis through the “center” of the print (the origin of the tire axis system).
At low and medium slip angles the tire tends to align its heading with its path. In other words, tires like to point the way they are going. 

The aligning torque comes from the shape of the print. As seen before, the shape of the distortion in the print is roughly triangular and is not symmetric about the fore-aft (“prua - poppa”) center of the print. The elastic distortion in the print increases from front to back and this gives an uneven distribution of lateral force alongthe lenght of the print. 
This uneven distribution gives rise to aligning torque. The latter is typically measured in punds - feet (or kilos per meter), at a given operating condition of slip angle and load.

*Pneumatic trail* is a different way of looking at this asymmetry in the print. The pneumatic trail is the distance from the fore-aft center of the print to the center of action of the lateral force. 
*==The tire aligning torque is the lateral force times the pneumatic trail, or, penumatic trail equals aligning torque divided by the lateral force==*.

### Linear Range - Low  slip angle
The higher stresses in the aft part of the print work to reduce the slip angle. This is true in the linear range of tire performance. 

### Nonlinear - High slip angle
At high slip angles, the rear of the print is sliding laterally along the ground. This reduces the amount of stabilizing aligning torque. At breakway (the friction limit) the aligning torque is reduced to near zero, ad in many cases actually reverses sign. 
This means that when the tire is sliding, it no longer has any tendency to line up with its path (and may actually try to increase its slip angle).

## Mechanical Trail, Pneumatic Trail and Steering Torques
*Trail* is illustrated by a swiveling caster. The tire print trails behind its steering pivot.
In other words, the caster angle gives a mechanical trail.
Another way to obtain mechanical trail is to move the kingpin forward of the wheel centre.
_The Mechanical Trail refers to the lenght of the lever that, when combined with the print, produces a self righting effect on the wheel.

![](pneumatic_and_mechanic_trail.jpg)

The alingning torque can also be thought of as a “trail” effect, hence the term *pneumatic trail* as noted on the image above. The pneumatic trail is always present and changes with tire operating conditions. 

The sum of the mechanical trail plus the pneumatic trail times the lateral force gives the **steer torque** about the kingpin (assuming that any other torques cancel out when left and right wheel effects are added).

- - -

## Longitudinal Force
In order to accelerate or brake a vehicle, longitudinal forces must be developed between the tires and the ground, in the tire footprints. No change in speed (acceleration) can take place without an applied force acting on the vehicle mass in accordance with Newton’s second law. 
The mechanism in the tire for developing longitudinal forces bears some relationship to that for lateral forces inasmuch as there is an elastic distortion region (in case longitudinal stretching) and a sliding or frictional region.
In the case of acceleration, for instance, the tire is experiencing a driving torque at zero slip angle (straight wheel).

## Tractive Force
In the image below the axle of the wheel is fixed and horizontal and the platform representing the road is moved relative to it. This situation shown corresponds in real life to the tire rolling forward to the left of the figure under the action of the applied driving torque, 

![](tire_print_characteristics_driving.jpg)

As indicated, the driving torque produces a for $M_t$.
As indicated, the driving torque produces a forward reaction, i.e., the tractive force, $F_t$, applied from the road to the tire. This force moves the tire footprint forward relative to the axle, compressing the thread elements ahead of the print and deforming the tire in a circumferential direction to accomodate.

The shear stress (road to tire) is in the forward direcction and tread elements of the tire are bent forward relative to the tire carcass. As more and more elements enter the print and move aft (“poppa” - ovvero nel senso opposto al verso di rotolamento dello pneumatico in questo caso), into the region of increasing local load, the shear stress builds up in a linear fashion as shown by curve 2 of the figure.

*The longitudinal shear force falls off as the rear of the print becomes unloaded. Sliding then occurs between the rear thread elements and the road - the elements which were bent forward now tend to straighten up.*

The longitudinal velocity in the print relative to the velocity of the undeflected tire is shown in the bottom of the above figure.

All this explanations gather us enough information to say that, _this slinding in the print means that the revolutions/miles of a tire under a driving torque are greater than for a free-rolling tire.

## Braking Force
The image shown below is similar to the tractive force one. The only thing changing is that the applied torque, $M_b$, is in the braking direction. As in the one before too, the slip angle here is still zero (questo significa che la ruota frena dritta, senza qualche momento sterzante applicato ad essa).
This torque produces a braking force from the road to the tire, called $F_b$. This force is repsonsible of moving the print back relative to the axle, compressing the thread elements of the tire aft (“poppa” - quindi in questo caso verso destra) of the print. 

*The braking force $F_b$ also tends to pull and stretch those tread elements ahead of the print. You can in fact compare the stretching effect on the tire surface as shown with C3 and C2. As you can clearly see, C3 is greater than C2, which means that the stretching on the tread is bigger.*

![](tire_print_characteristics_braking.jpg)

As more and more elements enter the print and move aft under increasing load, the longitudinal shear force will build up linearly as indicated by the curve 2. The free-rolling longitudinal shear force is given by the curve 1. The approximate ner shear strress is given by curve 3 (the sum of curves 1 and 2).
As the print unloads towards the rear, sliding occurs between the tread elements and the road. Relative to the carcass the backward-bent elements tend to strighten up and the sliding velocity is shown by the bottom curve.

## Slip Ratio.
Tractive force $F_t$ and braking force $F_b$ are function of slip ratio. As the slip ratio increases (numerically) from zero, the forces rise rapidly to a maximum which usually occurs in the range of 0.10 to 0.15 slip ratio, after which all the forces fall off.
Up to the peak the forces depend heavily on the elastic properties of the thread and carcass. After the peak the forces depend on a variety of factors such as tread composition, road texture, surface moisture, speed, tire temperature, etc.

In these two next graphs you can note how, in the traction case, the force falls off rapidly after the onset of spinning. This is for dry surface. Traction slip ratio curves can be obtained by recording drawball pull (which is the amount of horizontal force available to a vehicle at the drawball for accelerating or pulling a load) against a dynamometer truck while recording test wheel rpm.
Braking slip ratio curves can be measured with a trailer where the wheel is progressively braked. 

Once a tire exceeds the slip ratio for peak force in either traction or braking, it becomes unstable and the wheel tends to either spin up (traction) or lock (braking).

![](typical_traction_and_braking_slip_ratio_curve.jpg)


### Combined Operation
For the race driver, the effect of traction and braking forces under cornering conditions is important. Although braking id initiated on the straight prior to a coner, it is generally carried on into the turn. Similarly, tractive effort may begin after the turn apex and continue onto the straight.

### Sakai Data Plots
Comprehensive data on lateral and logitudinal force as a function of slip angle and slip ratio is relatively rare.
One published set of data was obtained by Sakai at the Japan Automobile Research Institute. This data was taken on a small passenger car tire at a load of 400Kg and a speed of 20 km/h. Although the tire and operating conditions are far from those of racing, this data gives a qualitative feel for the effects of combined slip angle and slip ratio. 
To a first order, tire forces/moments are independent of speed.

In this data, Sakai defines longitudinal force as positive rearward (breaking) and lateral force as positive to the right (right-hand turn). He defines two slip ratios, as described in the above tabulation of slip ratio definitions. The following table shows the difference between te SAE and Sakai definition of slip ratio:

![](difference_between_sae_and_sakai_slip_angle_definitions.jpg)

In order to give the reader a good understanding of the effect of combined slip angle/slip ratio on tire forces, four plots have been made from Sakai’s published data. *These are presented using his sign convention and his definitions of slip ratio.*

Figure shown below shows the **effect of slip angle on the relationship between the traction/braking forces and slip ratio.**

**To reach peak traction / breaking forces requires a higher and higher slip ratio as the slip angle is increased.** The peak value is somewhat lowered under breaking instances.

![](braking_and_traction_forces_vs_slip_ratio_and_slip_angle.jpg)

Figure below, on the other hand presents the **effect of slip angle on the relationship between lateral force and slip ratio.**
It will be noted that peak lateral force occurs under breaking in the slip ratio range of 0.0 to +0.05, Sb. At any slip ratio the lateral force increases with slip angle, but at a progressively lower rate, as slip ratio (either traction of breaking) is increased.

![](lateral_force_vs_slip_ratio_and_slip_angle..jpg)

Figure below represents the same data plotted in a more familiar form - the cornering force curve (lateral force vs. slip angle) but with lines of constant slip ratio instead of constant load. It can be see that the slope of the cornering force curve falls off rapidly with increase in traction or breaking slip ratio.

![](effect_of_slip_angle_and_slip_ratio_on_lateral_force.jpg)

## Resultant Force vs. Resultant Slip Velocity
One can gain a more general understanding of the development of tire forces by noting that they all originate within the print as a result of some slip.

*Although it is convenient to think in terms of longitudinal and lateral forces, and slip ratio and slip angle (producing lateral slip), the tire only knows a resultant force and a resultant slip velocity.*

From the graphs above of the breaking / traction forces and of the lateral forces the *resultant force and slip velocity have been computed and plotted in to the below shown graph.*

<u>Note</u>: Some scatter due to the basic tire data and its manipulation is to be expected.

![](resultant_force_vs_resultant_slip_velocity.jpg)

## Camber Effects
Camber angle, $\phi$, is defined as **the angle between a tilted wheel place and the vertical.**

The camber is *positive* if the *wheel leans outward at the top relative to the vehicle*, or *negative* if *it leans inward*. 

In this system, the tilt of the wheel is referred to as the *inclination angle*, γ.
The inclination angle is positive if the wheel is tilted to the right when viewed from behind the rolling tire.

In racing circles, the tilt of a wheel is universally referred to as **camber**, with the sign conventions following as above. The effect of camber on the tire forces and moments actually depends on the angle between the tire and a perpendicular to the ground - as opposed to the angle between the tire and the chassis reference. 

<u>Note</u>: In the following figures, data is presented from several sources and generally refers to operating conditions that might be found at the **outside front wheel** of a car in a **right-hand (+) turn.**

## Camber Force
In general, a ~cambered rolling pneumatic-tired wheel produces a lateral force in the direction of the tilt~. When this force occurs at zero slip angle, it is referred to as *camber thrust*. A lateral force component due to camber can also occur at slip angles other than zero.

*Camber force is a function of the tire type, construction, shape, tread, pressure, load, tractive/breaking effort, and camber and slip angles.*

Experimental observations on a glass plate and simple theory indicate that camber thrust of narrow bias-ply tires arises form a lateral distortion of the print. When a stationary tire is pressed down onto the road at camber angle, the center plane of the print is curved (a). When the tire is rolled at zero slip angle (b), a point entering the print is constrained by the road to move through the print on a straight path defined by the direction of motion. Thus the road applies forces to the tire which tend to remove the curvature in the stationary (nonrolling) tire print. The sum of these forces is what can be defined as **camber thrust**.

![](distortion_in_print_of_a_tire_at_a_camber_angle.jpg)

It is possible to to compare the lateral force produced by camber angle to that produced by slip angle. Because of the shape and size of the print distortion patterns, the lateral force generated in the linear (small angle) range by one degree of slip angle is greater than that generated by one degree of camber.

For traditional bias tires the cornering stiffness, is generally five to six times greater than the camber stifness.

For radial tires the camber stiffness may be quite small since the lateral stifness of the belt and the flexibility of the radial cord sidewall inhibit the kind of print distortion that gives rise to camber thrust. Such camber thrust as is generated may be due to distortion in the thread pattern or sidewall effects. 

<u>Note</u>: For wide street radial tires the camber forces tend to fall off at camber angles above 5°. For racing tires, the maximum force due to camber occurs at smaller angles.
It is interesting to note that for rounded cross-section motorcycle tires, camber produces useful lateral force up to  perhaps 50°.

### Aligning Torque due to Camber
Camber also affects the aligning torque (or pneumatic trail). The roughly triangular distortion pattern of the print due to slip angle (the lateral forces in the print increasing toward the back) gives rise to an aligning torque wich is “stabilizing” in the linear range.
On the other hand, aligning torques due to camber are generally quite small because of the fore and aft symmetry of the print distortion.

Usually, the aligning torque due to camber tends to increase the slip angle. In combination with slip angle, the two effects tend to cancel and this may require an increase in mechanical trail to produce the desired centering effect.

### Camber Roll-Off and Peak Lateral Force
In the linear range, camber thrust and lateral force due to slip angle are generally viewed as separate effects and are additive. This simply moves the cornering curve (lateral force vs slip angle) up or down parallel to itself depending on which way the wheel is cambered.

As the linear range is exceeded, the additive camber effect decreases or is said to “roll-off” as seen in the graph shown below.  

![](camber_thrust_and_camber_roll_off_at_constant_load.jpg)

Measurements made on a narrow bias-ply tire demonstrate that the peak of the cornering curve can move up when tire is tilted into the turn while the peak generally moves down if the tire is tilted outward.

![](peak_side_force_vs_camber.jpg)

<u>Note</u>: The slip angle at each point on these curves is that which gave maximum lateral force.

Although no complete theory exists to explain the increase it is obiviously associated with what happens in the print of the tire.

*Road-induced distortion due to **slip angle** is maximum towards the rear of the print where local vertical forces are* **low**; the *largest distortion in the case of **camber** is near the center of the print where the local vertical forces are* **high**.
Comes as a consequence that slippage in the highly loaded center of the print is less likely than at the lightly loaded end of the print. This may help explain why higher lateral force is achieved when “aiding” camber is added to the slip angle.

### Typical Cambered Tire Data
The tire under inspection was tested at 35 psi pressure at 60 mph under dry conditions on this flat belt tire tester.
The first graph shown is at 0° camber. The curves are labeled in terms of steer angle instead of slip angle; steering the wheels to the right is positive (+). The graph indicates that the lateral force-producing capability of the non-cambered tire is about the same for right and left steer. The tire behaviour then, with 0° camber configuration is nearly symmetrical.

![](lateral_froce_at_zero_camber.jpg)

The next two graphs show instead the setup of wheel tilted at 5° and 10° to the right, respectively. In both instances the curves are asymmetrical. When the wheel is tilted to the right the lateral force produced by the right steer is greater than with left steer. The camber has the effect of rotating the set of curves in a counterclockwise direction around the origin.
For the relatively wide tires the test has been made on, -5° of camber yields most of the gain in lateral force from camber.

![](lateral_force_at_neg_five_camber.jpg)

While above is shown the graph for the negative 5° of camber angle, below you can see the figure representative for the 10° negative camber angle on the tire.

![](lateral_force_at_neg_ten_camber.jpg)

### Camber Optimization
Curves such as those seen in the last three graphs above, or normalized versions as well, are useful for adjusting the camber to achieve maximum lateral force on a wheel at a known load and slip angle condition.

The figure listed below is a plot of normalized lateral force vs load for three camber angles all at 7° of steer angle in a right-hand turn. This specific steer angle was chosen as close to the peak for the three camber angles.

## Other Tire Effects
So far this section on tire mechanics ha concentrated on forces, moments, and angles that relate the tire to the roads surface. This section lumps together several other factors that affect tire performance.

### Tire Pressure
Tire pressure is one of the easiest and most common changes made in setting up a race car. The range of permissible pressures is frequently set by the tire manufacturer generally for reasons of durability. 

Tire performance at low slip angle and modest side forces is described by the cornering stifness or the slip of the lateral force versus slip angle curve seen in the graph below.

![](lateral_force_vs_slip_angle_for_a_racing_tire.jpg)

This slope shown in the graph is a measure of the tires’s elastic properties - if the pressure is raised the carcass will get stiffer (less easy to distort) and the cornering stiffness will increase as a consequence. 

For a given small slip angle, an increase in pressure will give an increase in lateral force. By varing the pressures front to rear, modest changes in the under/oversteer balance of the vehicle can be achieved. 

Tire performance at the peak of the curve in the graph shown above depends on the effective friction coefficient of the tire with the ground. Even if not very well understood, in general, lowering the contact pressure between the rubber tread and the road raises the effective friction coefficient between the two. Lowering the air pressure increases the size of the footprint and lowers the contact pressure in the print.

_The general idea on the tire pressures is to set the air pressure such that the center thread (supported mostly by pressure) and the edges of the thread (supported by pressure and the sidewalls of the tire) carry a proportional share of the load.

Aligning torque is also affected by pressure. As the pressure is decreased, the print becomes longer and the center of lateral force moves rearward.

Tire drag will be decreased by an increase in pressure. There are two mechanisms of tire drag. The *rolling resistance* is a measure of energy lost in deforming the tire; with higher pressure, distortion and print size are reduced.
Tire *induced drag* (drag resulting from cornering) will be reduced for a given required lateral force (below the limit) if the pressure is increased because the required slip angle is lower.

### Tire Temperature
Tire temperature affects both the force-producing capability of the tire and also the life of the tire too. The first question that must be considered regarding tire temperature is, “what temperature?”

The tire carcass is an elastic device that is partly responsible for the cornering stiffness. A change in temperature will change the modulus of elasticity of the rubber (unlike steel for example where this is constant over a large temperature range) and affect the cornering stiffness.

Tire pressure and temperature are interrelated - lower initial pressure results in more rubber distortion and higher temperature, which in turn results in higher “hot” pressure.

Modern race tire tread compounds have an optimum temperature for maximum grip. If too cold, the tires are very slippery while if too hot the tread rubber will “melt”; in between the two is the correct temperature for operation. Unfortunately, the tire's temperature change continuoasly as the pressure, speed and operating forces vary.

### Speed Effect
Every tire performance varies with speed even it the effect is not consistent enough to be generalized. The only thing that seems likely is that tire force capability drops off as speed is increased. This drop-off may be gradual with increase in speed or abrupt in a narrow range of speeds. In some cases the lateral force capability increases slightly again as speed increases past a certain point.

### Conicity and Plysteer
Tires have “non-symmetrical due to fabrication and design” which create lateral force and aligning torque when a tire is tested at zero slip and camber angles. Two non-symmetries which occur in steady-state testing are conicity and plysteer which displace the measured curves from zero. On the vehicle this gives rise to steering/vehicle “pull” and “dog tracking”.

Lets understand what these two terms mean by using the following definitions:
- *Conicity* - This term was apparently derived by considering a tire to assume the shape of a truncated cone. Based on geometry such a configuration would generate a force towards the apex of the cone regardless of which direction the tire or “cone “ was rotated.
- Plysteer - This component of the lateral force variation describes the influence of the plies in a tire in generating forces which could steer the vehicle from its intended straight line course. Plysteer, by definition, is a force component which changes direction with reverse rotation, when measuring the tire lateral force variations.

But what do steering/vehicle “pull” and “dog tracking” mean? Let’s see:
- Vehicle or steering pull happens primarly because of asymmetric lateral forces in the tires, leading to steering change, correction or drift due to the “cone-shape” of the tire under testing.
- Vehicle or steering dog tracking results from misalignment or uneven forces affecting the **rear axle** of the car, making the car move laterally relative to its intended path.

## Friction Circle and Ellipse
In this section a single diagram is shown which combines the longitudinal and lateral forces. This diagram is composed of so-called friction ellipses and the friction circle. The friction circle represents the force-producing limit of the tire for a given set of operating conditions like load, surface, temperature, etc. This diagram for a single wheel/tire is conceptually similar to the friction circle diagram for the whole vehicle.

The graph shown below is a plot of lateral force vs. longitudinal (breaking/traction) force for a series of slip angles and slip ratios. Only the right half of the diagram is shown. Lateral force is measured perpendicular to the wheel plane and longitudinal force is measured in the wheel plane.

![](friction_circle_diagram_right_hand_turn.jpg)

### General Description of the Diagram
The vertical axis represents longitudinal force and various slip ratios are marked along the scale. Note that (+) is down and braking whole traction is up and (-) from the Sakai convention. Points on the vertical axis, on the other hand, could be used to develop the curves of slip ratio vs. longitudinal forces.

The interesting part of the diagram is off-axis, where combined traction/breaking and lateral force are represented. For example, point “A” on the figure represents the force that is generated by 4° of slip angle and a slip ratio of about +0.036. This can be read off the force scales on the axes as 800 lb. of lateral force and 500 lb. of longitudinal force (braking).

In general, a circle is a close approximation to the boundary of the diagram - this “friction circle” representes the maximum force that the tire can generate under these operating conditions. In racing, the tire is operated at or near the limit of the friction circle.

At point B for example, the tire is given pure lateral force as its best slip angle of 1100lb. 
If 600 lb. of tractive force is applied, the available lateral force drops to about 920 lb. at point C. The combined force, the vector sum of the lateral and longitudinal forces, is still 1100 lb. as shwon by the arrow labeled Fresultant.

<u>Note</u>: The “g-g” diagram for the whole vehicle is a composite of the friction circle diagrams for all four wheels of the vehicle, taking into account load transfers (and other effects) which affect the size and shape of these four friction circles.

## SAE Tire Axis System
The only external forces acting on a car are gravity, aerodynamic forces and tire forces.
The tire forces may be viewed as road forces acting on the car as a result of tire-road interaction. In this section we show how tire forces produce certain forces and moments and how traction forces (both driving and breaking) and lateral forces result in thrust and drag forces. Again, *the algebraic signs assume that the road applies the forces and moments to the tire*.

The tire axis system adopted for vehicle dynamics and tire work is that shown in the graph below. This axis system, from SAE J670, has its origin at O, the center of the tire footprint (tire stationary). The origin, O, is at the intersection of the z axis with the road plane; flat level road is assumed. The x axis is at the intersection of the wheel plane with the road plane. The z axis is vertical and passes through O. The last but not least axis, y, is perpendicular to x and z and lies on the road plane.

The figure shows the wheel at a positive inclination angle, $\gamma$, and a positive slip angle, $\alpha$. $R_l$ is the loaded wheel radius, the distance from the conter of tire contact to the wheel center measured in the wheel plane. It is not the effective rolling radius or revolutions/mile. 

![](sae_tire_axis_system.jpg)

Slip angle, $\alpha$, is (+) when the wheel is “slipping” to the right; this is negative steer like with the wheel steered to the left.
On the other hand, inclination angle, $\gamma$, has a different sign convention than camber angle:
In fact, when viewed from the *rear* of the car, if the tires are leaning like this:

![](camber_vs_inclination_angle.jpg)

Inclination angle is strictly used for tire data. To use camber angle on a vehicle, the signs must be converted.

## Discussion o Tire Forces
This section and the following section discuss tire forces and tire moments as defined by the SAE axis system. In addition, some analysis is given of certain combinations of these components that are significant to the vehicle as a whole.

### $F_z$: Normal Force (Load)
All tire forces and moments are a function of load as well as other operating variables. For a given set of tires, the load primarily determines the amount of force available to accelerate the vehicle, both laterally and longitudinally. 
The normal force, $F_z$, and its road reaction, $F_zR$, also appear in $M_x$ and $M_y$.

### $F_x$: Tractive Force and $F_y$: Lateral Force
The mechanism for the generation of tire tractive forces, either in the driving or breaking direction, has been discussed earlier in this chapter.
It was shown that tractive force, $F_x$, which is in the direction of the wheel plane, is a function of longitudinal slip ratio, S.
Now, these two forces are treated together because we are interested in how they affect vehicle *thurst* and *drag*.

The total thrust or drag is given by resolving the lateral and longitudinal forces along the velocity direction,

T or D = $F_x \cdot cos\alpha - F_y \cdot sin\alpha$

For example, the first case when slip angle, $\alpha = 0$. A drag force, $F_r$, is produced at the road interface, the result of the rolling loss at the contact patch. 

![](components_of_the_net_rolling_resistance.jpg)

<u>Note</u>: The effective friction coefficients ($\mu$) front and rear are obtained by dividing the lateral force by the normal force acting on the wheel.

## Discussion of Tire Moments
The tire moments will be discussed first in the context of zero $\gamma$ (inclination angle) or $\alpha$ (slip angle); this will help in visualizing how the moments are generated. Late, we discuss the $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ effects briefly.

### Mz: Aligning Torque (or Moment)
Earlier in this resume, the mechanism of aligning torque was shown to be a result of the lateral force distribution along the lenght of the tire footprint when there is a slip angle, $\alpha$.
The way wheel aligning torque is accounted for is illustrated in the figure shown below.

![](aligning_torque.jpg)

In the 2DF model it is assumed that the tire sideforce due to α passes through the center of the footprint. In actuality, it is behind that point by the pneumatic trail distance, t. The assumed position is valid if we add an aligning torque, of magnitude $F_y \cdot t$, around a vertical axis passing through the footprint center. 

In the figure above, the torque will be counterclockwise - trying to make the wheel plane rotate in a direction to align itself with the felocity vector.

In summary, aligning torque due to steer is in a direction to reduce the steer angle (stable). Aligning torque due to camber is usually in a direction to increase the steer angle (unstable).

The aligning torques associated with the wheels of a care are a weak function of inclination angle (camber), $\gamma$, and a strong function of slip angle, $\alpha$.

The aligning torques are externally applied by the road to the car and they figure in the yaw moment equation for a complete car.

### $M_x$: Overturning Moment
An overturning moment about x is present whenever the road reaction force, $F_{zR}$ (which acts upward), is not in the same plane as the wheel load, $F_z$ (which acts downwards). This is shown in the figure below:

![](tire_overturning_moment.jpg)

The road reaction force, $F_{zR}$, is out of the x-z plane, but, for vertical equilibrium, must equal $F_z$. The point at which $F_{zR}$ intersects the road plane is the centroid of the footprint pressure.
This centroid of the upward road pressure is displaced by a distance, $\epsilon$, as show.
The shift, $\epsilon$, results when any set of conditions distorts the footprint laterally.
This will occur if a side force is applied along the wheel spin axis.

Of course, if a wheel is moving straight ahead with $\alpha = \gamma = 0$, the overturning moment is negligibly small and is produced mainly by tire imperfections. When $\alpha$ and/or $\gamma$ are present, side forces are generated, resulting in footprint distortion and lateral shifting of $F_{zR}$.

### $M_y$: Rolling Resistance Moment
The term of rolling resistance moment is confined to the “resistance” to forward motion of a free-rolling wheel. 

<u>Note</u>: The free rolling wheel is defined as one that is towed (or pushed) straight ahead in an upright position with all applied moments (internal and external) about the wheel spin axis nearly zero.

The figure below shows the essentials variables of the free rolling wheel diagram.

![](free_rolling_tire.jpeg)

In the figure shown above $F_t$ is the force required to tow the wheel at constant velocity, V. $F_r$ is the rolling resistance force and is equal and opposite to $F_t$. 

<u>Note</u>: The free rolling wheel produces no tractive force either driving or braking that is available to accelerate or brake the vehicle.

Again, the wheel load, $F_z$, is equal but opposite to the road reaction vertical force $F_{zR}$. Assume $T=0$ (so no applied torque), the road reaction resultant must pass through the spin axis because otherwise it would produce a moment about the spin axis; this establishes the distance d, where $F_{zR}$ intersects the road plane.
If $F_R$ were zero, $F_z$ and $F_{zR}$  would be collinear; $F_R$ (and $F_T$) exist because the periodic compression and expansion of the thread rubber (as the rubber goes through the contact patch) consumes energy.

Let's consider now a 2-Dimensional Car displayed in the figure below in which the driving wheels is at the rear end and the free-rolling wheel (frictionless bearings) is at the front.

![](rolling_resistance_torque.png)

Assume, for a moment, that the driving wheel has no rolling resistance but the front wheel has rolling resistance force of $F_R$ (negative respect the direction of the car). This means that the rear wheel has to provide a tractive force, $F_x$ , equal to $F_R$ to cruise at a constant velocity (neglecting aerodynamic forces.)

Hance, the magnitude of the the driving torque can be defined as:

$T = F_x R_l = F_R R_l = M_y$

In summary, the rolling resistance moment, $M_y$, is of primary concern in power calculations since it manifests itself as driving torque to overcome $F_R$.

In the figure below it shows the graph plotting rolling resistance moment as a function of load on the tire:

# Aerodynamic Fundamentals
Aerodynamic forces and moments, as well as the tire-road forces, affect "g-g" maneuvering performance (and stability and control). Unlike the tire forces which are primarily independent of speed, the aerodynamic forces increase rapidly with speed.

For example, *aerodynamic drag determines the vehicle's performance characteristics at high speed including maximum speed, forward acceleration at the higher speeds, and braking deceleration* since modern open-wheel race cars have high enough drag that merely closing the throttle at top speed will decelerate the car about 1g.

In addition to the direct effects of aerodynamic forces, the interaction of the aerodynamic and tire forces can have a large effect on lateral acceleration performance. For example, aerodynamic downforce (negative lift) increases the tire load and this in turn increases the lateral force capability of the tires.

### Generalities
The race car aerodynamicist is confronted with such problems as:

- Reducing aerodynamic drag by external shaping, flow control, and efficient duct design for internal flow.
- Generating as much aerodynamic download and/or lateral force as possible, with the constraint that the drag not be too high.
- Wind tunnel testing, interpretation of wind tunnel test results and full-scale aero-dynamic testing.
- Coping with aerodynamic/chassis coupling effects as "porpoising" in ride height with ground-effects cars.

## Properties of Air
The atmosphere is composed of a physical mixture of gasses.

The interaction between the particles of a gas mixture, in this case air, are of two kinds: 
- Two **particles can collide with each other with no sliding at the interface of the contact** (hence producing "normal" or pressure forces).
- Two **particles can slide by each other** (hence producing "tangential" or shear forces.)
  
The interactions described in these two latter points can be visualized as if the air particles were cubes, as sketched in the image below.

![][air_normal_and_tangential_forces.png]

In reality, both types of interactions occur simultaneously but the relative magnitude of the two types of forces varies widely.

In fact, in most of the air surrounding and flowing around a body, the tangential or shear forces (which mainly depend on the internal friction or viscosity of the air) are very small in comparison to the normal forces.
The air particles, interact mostly with forces perpendicular to the line of contact (normal forces).

Considering now the thin layer of air next to a body, called the _boundary layer_ the shear forces are important. In the layer just described, the air particles next to the body adhere to the surface while the particles at short distance away are at *free stream velocity*. In this exact layer, due to its velocity gradient, there are large sliding velocities and hence way more tangential forces than normal ones.

There is an additional situation in which an interaction occurs between the boundary layer and the free stream which can result in so-called *separated flow*. This turbulent and stalled condition results in high drag and loss of lift.

### Density
Air surrounds the earth in a layer that is many miles high. Air has a mass and there is a gravitational attraction between the air and the earth in accordance with Newton's law of gravitation. 

Air is a gas in which the particles are moving at random velocities. The energy of the particles is affected by temperature - the higher the temperature the greater the particle velocities and the wider the particle spacings. Of course, if the temperature is increased, the inter-particle spacing increases and the column must get taller; if the temperature decreases the column gets shorter.

*So, according to what just stated, the number of particles per unit height will change; the weight air density which is the weight per unit volume will change with temperature*.

The density of air changes in the following ways:
- **Change in temperature** - A change in temperature can be due to atmospheric temperature changes, or a localized condition such as air exiting a radiator.
- **Change in pressure** - Air density is directly proportional to barometric pressure. A change in the barometric pressure can be either due to atmospheric weather conditions or due to a change in altitude (less air is stacked up above at higher altitudes). 

### Viscosity
Viscosity can be defined as the "stickiness" of a fluid. For example, oil is more viscous than water. The viscosity of a fluid is determined by the forces created within the fluid when there are velocity differences within the fluid itself.
The viscous forces are transmitted between the fluid and to any solid body through a thin boundary layer of fluid that is attached to the body surface. The more viscous the fluid, the more force is transmitted to the body from the fluid. In the same manner, the more viscous a fluid, the harder it is to move a body through such fluid.

Note that the effect of temperature change on absolute viscosity as well as the effect of temperature change on density might be significant.

## Bernoulli's Equation
Bernoulli's equation describes the conditions existing in the free stream, outside the boundary layer.
It takes into consideration pressure (normal forces) and velocity as air flows smoothly around a body. 

*From this equation, it is possible to predict surface pressures and lift for many types of shapes, specifically those shapes where no separation is present and boundary layer growth is small.* Since drag depends on tangential forces (boundary layer effects) it is not treated by Bernoulli's equation.

As indicated earlier, the flow around bodies outside the boundary layer is predominantly non viscous with normal or pressure forces between the air particles. For the subsonic speeds associated with race cars, the air density changes are small except in cases where large temperature changes occur (see the previous example of air exiting a radiator).

<u>Note</u>: In aerodynamics, the principle of relative motion is assumed. Thus the air can be stationary with a body moving through it, or the body can be stationary with the air moving past it (as in a wind tunnel);  the pressure/velocity relationships will be the same. For the following derivation the air is moving.

Consider a tube of air, a *stream tube*, made up of streamlines shown in the figure below:

![][stream_tube.png]

**A streamline is the path of successive air particles in a steady flow.**

The outer surface of this tube is in effect a boundary since no air flows through it. The size and velocity of the tube will be described by Bernoulli's equation.
Such tubes of air might, for example, pass over and under a wing. The cross-sectional area of these tubes will change with pressure changes as it they were elastic.

![][tubes_around_an_aerodynamic_profile.png]
A stream tube is composed of a frictionless and incompressible fluid, and is an isolated system (no flow though the boundaries). 

**Because of this the total energy must remain constant along its length but this energy can appear in different forms.**
In this situation three forms of energy are possible:
- **Potential Energy** - is associated with a height change of the fluid. It is given by $W_z$, where w is the specific weight and z is the height change. For automotive flow, this term is negligible.
-  **Kinetic Energy** - is given by $\frac{1}{2} mV^2$ , where m is the mass (in slugs) and V is the velocity.
  
  This kinetic energy corresponds to the amount of work required to take this small mass of fluid and accelerate it to the velocity, V.
  
  - **Pressure energy** - the stream tube is located in a fluid body which is under a static pressure at its outer boundaries (from the weight of all the air above it). This external pressure acts uniformly in all directions (as does pressure in any fluid) and the fluid element must be at an equal pressure to be in equilibrium.

The pressure energy in the fluid element is equal to the work required to maintain its volume against the external pressure. This work is equal to $p \cdot vol$, where $p$ is the external (and internal as them are the same value) pressure.

The following picture shows the acting forces (simplified) on a small piece of volume inside the stream tube:

![][stream_tube_element_of_volume.png]

### Discussion of Bernoulli's Equation
This section will discuss each of the terms, $p$, $q$, and $H$, in Bernoulli's equation in some detail, with particular reference to how they are measured. In order:

- **Static Pressure** ($p$) - is the pressure in the airstream (frequently referred to a $static$ pressure). Since it is not usually convenient to move an instrument along with the airstream, the static pressure in a moving airstream is commonly *measured with a static tube*.
  
  In this specific tube, the holes are normally several diameters aft of the nose to insure that the flow is parallel to the tube wall (the tube must be oriented in the flow direction).
  
  The static pressure may also be measured by a *flush pressure tap along the wall of a wind tunnel or on the surface of a body in an airstream*, provided that the flow is attached and moving parallel to the surface, as shown in the figure below.

![][static_pressure_tap_for_measuring_p.png]

<u>Note</u>: When a pressure measurement is referenced to atmospheric pressure it is called **gauge pressure**. Gauge pressures lower than atmospheric are frequently called negative pressures. They are not negative pressures, merely pressures lower than the atmospheric reference pressure.

-  **Dynamic Pressure** ($q$) - is the *dynamic* pressure, the pressure that would be realized if the kinetic energy of the moving fluid at a given point were converted to a pressure.
  
  The dynamic pressure, $q$, is usually measured indirectly. Thus from Bernoulli's equation, $q = H-p$, where $H$ is measured as described below.
  
  - **Total Pressure** ($H$) - is the *total* pressure, as defined by Bernoulli's equation, $H = p+q$. Where $H$ is the total of the pressure and velocity energy in the fluid.

$H$ can be measured by an open-ended tube, shown in the figure below, in which the air is brought to restart at the nose of the tube (air is assumed incompressible at automotive speeds). The size of the tube, as indicated by experiment, is not critical. The measured pressure is called the *stagnation pressure*.

![][total_pressure_tap_to_measure_H.png]

- **Stagnation Pressure** - any time the air splits to go around a body in two or more different directions there will be a small region (point) of stagnation pressure equal to the static pressure plus the stop or dynamic pressure. This stagnation pressure is equal to $p+q$, where the point of interest is shown on the wing below.

![][stagnation_point.png]
As shown in the picture below the streamline at the stagnation point is the border between the flows over and under the vehicle.

### Dynamic Pressure and Velocity Measurement
If the total head, $H$, and the static pressure, $p$, are known at a point in the fluid, the dynamic pressure can be obtained by subtraction, as noted before: 

$q=\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 = H -p$

The conventional **pitot static tube type of airspeed indicator**, shown in the figure below, is based on this principle.

![][pitot_static_tube_airspeed_indicator.png]

## Pressure Distribution
Bernoulli's equation indicates that *if the dynamic pressure is increased, the static pressure in the stream must decrease*, or vice versa.
An air foil is a device which utilizes these pressure changes to generate force. 

<u>Note</u>: With the air foil shape shown below, the air must increase in speed as it goes over both the top and bottom surfaces, but more so over the top as the curvature and the distance travelled are greater.

![][air_foil.png]

<u>Note</u>: It should be remembered that the air behaves as an incompressible fluid and the *condition of continuity* says that the same number of particles of air passing a cross-section near the trailing edge of the air foil shape.

As shown in the picture below, *the stream tube will be thinner where where the velocity of the air is higher, over the thicker part of the air foil.* 

![][elastic_tubes_air_foil.png]

The stream tubes behave as if they were elastic - *as the air speeds up, the static pressure decreases and the tubes shrink in size. As, on the other hand, the air slows down again toward the trailing edge the tubes expand under the increasing pressure*. 
This is called **pressure recovery**.

In this specific case, **the air foil generates lift because the reduced pressure over the top of the wings is greater than the reduced pressure under the bottom**. 
The air is moving faster over the top. In the figure shown below the pressure arrows are shown, drawn perpendicular to the surface.

<u>Note</u>: The pressure arrows are drawn perpendicular to the surface of the air foil as a result of the assumption that there are no tangential (shearing) forces in the perfect fluid under discussion.

![][pressure_distribution_around_a_wing.png]

As it can be seen from the image above, **the pressure distribution area A on the top of the air foil is greater than Area B, on the bottom, resulting in an upward lift**.

Bernoulli's equation says that the kinetic energy in the airstream (the dynamic pressure or velocity head) can be exchanged for static pressure. 

**The static pressure exerts a force on a surface and this is available for uses such as generating downforce.** The downforce (lift) is limited by the magnitude of the dynamic pressure available. 

The quantity $\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2=q$ determines the energy that is available to work with.

<u>Note</u>: The energy available increases with the square of the speed and directly with the air density.

The effectiveness of converting dynamic pressure to static pressure and lift, for example, depends on the shape of the body itself and how it is displaced on the car. In fact, the wing section shown in the picture below is very effective in creating downforce when it is angled to the free stream as shown. It may be said that this wing configuration has a high shape efficiency as regards down lift.

![][wing_section.png]

## Consideration of Real Flows
As stated in the previous section, velocity and pressure relationships were treated for an ideal fluid moving around smooth body shapes such as air foils. Since air does not always act like a perfect fluid and few race cars are finely streamlined shapes, this section contains some general remarks on the characteristic of real airflows.

In the first place, consider the boundary layer of the air at the body surface. In this layer the shear forces (viscous effects) are important. **In fact, these shear forces tend to slow the airflow down and remove energy from the moving stream.** 

The boundary layer tends to thicken along the length of the body, even if the body is very smooth. In practice, most boundary layers are _turbulent_. 
This means that the **air particles in the boundary layer are moving with random velocities and are constantly changing distance from the body surface**. This has the effect of distributing velocity energy throughout the layer which often helps to keep the boundary layer attached to the body and free stream following the body contour.

<u>Note</u>: Toward the rear end of typical automotive shapes the boundary later can separate from the body and the flow will break down into large-scale turbulence know as the distributed _wake_ as shown in the figure below.

![][critical_behaviour_of_a_hatchback_automobile.png]

The forward part of a body is a boundary and forces the air to speed up to get around it. Once the maximum section is reached and/or the body shape recedes, there is nothing that forces the airflow to expand and follow the body shape except pressure and velocity changes within the stream tubes.

<u>Note</u>: **Experience with wind tunnel design has shown that the air can only expand and follow a boundary slope of some 10° or less**. If the diffuser section in a wind tunnel (has pictured in the image below) has a steeper angle the flow will separate from the wall with the creation of a random turbulence.

To add, any sharp edge will result in separation. An infinite acceleration of the flow would be required to go around a sharp edge smoothly and that is not possible in a real fluid.

![][wind_tunnel_showing_diffuser_angle.png]

Of course, **separated flow is usually undesirable. The pressure in the wake region is low, causing an increase on the pressure drag**. Energy is required to maintain the turbulence and "drag along" the low-pressure region. Latter energy must come from the vehicle's power plant.

## Aerodynamic Testing
As for three-dimensional flows about bluff automotive shapes in close proximity to the ground (and not only that) are extremely complex, for race car designers, the wind tunnel and full-scale development will remain the chosen for aerodynamic development for some time.

This section takes into consideration and describes the aerodynamic forces and moment coefficients, that are widely used to compare one vehicle to another.

### Wind Tunnel Testing
The size of the wind tunnel determines the largest model size that can be used.
If the actual vehicle and some expensive tunnels is available it is of course desirable to test at full size as this avoids scaling problems with models.

<u>Note</u>: Ground plane simulations still remain one of the biggest problems in the wind tunnel simulations as much as tunnel wall and blockage corrections as much as speed corrections if the tunnel can not reach real life racing speeds.

During the design stage of a new vehicle it is often necessary to test a model in a smaller and less expensive wind tunnel. In this case there are two specific problems that must be addressed such as modelling the ground plane, and insuring that the model flow field is similar to the eventual full size vehicle flow field.

- The **modern race car has a very low ground clearance, this makes the simulations of flow under and around the sides of the car very complex and difficult to understand his behaviour under pitching and lift moments**.
  In addition, in real life the air is at rest relative to the road (for zero wind conditions) while the vehicle moves through it. On the other hand, **in a conventional wheel tunnel, the air is not at rest with the ground and a boundary layer builds up in front of the test model**.

As stated above, **air blowing along a flat plane will create a boundary layer**. This boundary layer will increase in thickness with distance from the leading edge of the plate.

![][boundary_layer_in_wind_tunnel.png]

### Reynolds Number
The basic condition for flow similarity between a model and a full scale vehicle is that they are both at the same Reynolds Number (RN).

The Reynolds Number is defined as:

$\frac{VL}{\upsilon}$ 

Where: $V$ is the airstream velocity, $L$ is an appropriately chosen length for characterization the flow pattern and $\upsilon$ us the kinematic viscosity defined earlier as $\mu / \rho$.

In the Properties of Air section at the beginning of this chapter it was pointed out that there are two kinds of interactions between air particles - normal and tangential. _The normal interactions involve inertia (mass) effects and the second involve friction (viscous) effects_.
**Reynolds Number similarity is based on the idea that if the ratio between these two kinds of interactions is constant the flow pattern will be similar**.

The dynamic pressure, $(1/2)\rho V^2$ , is the force per unit area that is realized if the kinetic energy of the moving particle is converted to a pressure by a collision with an object. In other words, it is an inertia force proportional to the dynamic pressure times the area on which it acts:

$\rho V^2 \cdot L^2$ 

Where $L$ is the chosen characteristic length.

The frictional force acting on a unit area is:

$\mu \cdot \frac{V}{L}$

Where $\mu$ is the absolute coefficient of viscosity and $V/L$ is the rate the velocity is changing with distance through the fluid layers.

Thus, $\mu \cdot V/L$ is the frictional force per unit area, and:

$(\mu \cdot \frac{V}{L}) \cdot L^2 = \mu VL$

is the actual frictional force.

The ratio of the inertia to the frictional force is proportional to

$\frac{\rho V^2 L^2}{\mu VL} = \frac{\rho VL}{\mu} = \frac{VL}{\upsilon} = RN$

<u>Note</u>: **As stated above already, to insure that flow patterns are similar between full-scale and model tests, the RN should be the same or at least as close as possible.**

Assuming that the value of $\upsilon$ is the same for both tests, then VL should also be the same for both tests. In addition, if the test scale is 1/4, the wind tunnel test speed would ideally be four times the vehicle speed. If that's not possible, it may be useful to repeat a test with several different speeds (so also different RN) and note the variation of the measured forces.

### Flow Visualization
It is highly desirable to be able to "see" the streamlines in a steady flow conditions and the extent of flow separation and wake size. This is important whether the test is performed in a wind tunnel or at the track. Although purely qualitative, flow visualization can indicate where problems exist and the extent of improvement when changes are made.

![][tufts_on_a_wing.png]

<u>Note</u>: Tufts can also be attached to a wire grid (plane perpendicular to the airstream) in a wind tunnel to determine wake conditions aft of a model.
A typical grid installation is shown in the figure below along with a photograph of the tufts as disturbed by a swept wing model.
This shows the generation of vortices aft of the wing tips. These types of vortex formations are common in the wake behind automobiles.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="tuft_grid.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
  <img src="tuft_grid_aft.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
</div>

<u>Note</u>: Low-speed wind tunnels have utilized smoke to give a visualization of the flow patterns. These two figures below show a bidimensional smoke tunnel and a typical flow picture.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="smoke_tunnel.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
  <img src="smoke_photo.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
</div>

Smoke can be generated in a ton amount of ways. Titanium or tin tetrachloride (both poisonous if concentrated) will produce smoke (poisonous as well) when brought into contact with moist air. Smoke tunnels have also used theatrical smoke and smoke from heated kerosene, rotted wood, or smouldering paper.

Another technique for flow visualization is that of painting the surface of a model with a mixture of lampblack and kerosene. The tunnel is then started up, the flow stabilized and the tunnel shut off. The streaks of lampblack on the model are then observed or photographed.

##  SAE Aerodynamic Axis System
Historically, wind tunnel facilities worldwide have used different nomenclature and reference axes. To avoid this and provide a common nomenclature for use in publishing road vehicle aerodynamics reports, the SAE Road Vehicle Committee published an international representation.

The axis system origin is located on the ground at mid-wheelbase and mid-track as shown in the figure below.

Where:
- $x$ is positive forward
- $y$ is positive right
- $z$ is positive downward

The additional equations shown below the figure allow transformation to forces and moments at axle positions, thus

- $LF$ = component of aero and lift at front axle
- $LR$ = component of aero lift at rear axle
- $SF$ = component of aero side force at front axle
- $SR$ = component of aero side force at rear axle

![][sae_aerodynamic_axis_system.png]
## Aerodynamic Force/Moment Coefficients
Aerodynamic forces and moments are primarily due to pressure over the body surface. A coefficient must then be introduced to take into account the effect of the body shape on the velocity distribution over the body and the orientation of the body in the fluid.
The **drag coefficient**, $C_D$, is defined as the following:

$C_D = \frac{Drag}{Aq} = \frac{D}{Aq} = \frac{D/A}{q}$

Where:
- $D$ = drag in lb.
- $A$ = reference area in $ft^2$, usually the frontal or plan area of the vehicle.
- $q$ = $q_\infty$  in $lb/ft^2$ 
- $C_D$ is nondimentional

Thus $C_D$ is the drag per unit area per unit $q_\infty$ (the kinetic energy in the airstream available for conversion to pressure and force).

Moments and torques result from aerodynamic forces and depend on a reference length, $WB$ (= wheelbase, $l$).

The six forces and moments are then given by:
- Lift, $L$ = $C_L q_\infty A$ (positive upward, $L = -F_z$)
- Drag, $D$ = $C_D q_\infty A$ (positive rearward, $D = -F_x$)
- Side Force, $S$ = $C_S q_\infty A$ (positive to right, $S = +F_y$)

- Pitching Moment, $PM$ = $C_{PM} q_\infty A \cdot WB$ (positive nose up, $PM = M_y$)
- Yawing Moment, $YM$ = $C_{YM} q_\infty A \cdot WB$ (positive nose up, $YM = M_z$)
- Rolling Moment, $RM$ = $C_{RM} q_\infty A \cdot WB$ (positive nose up, $RM = M_x$)

# Vehicle Axis System

At any given instant of time, a vehicle is subjected to a single force acting at some location and in some direction. This so-called external or applied force maintains the velocity or causes an acceleration of the vehicle. _This force is made up of tire, aerodynamic, and gravitational force components_.
Since these different components are governed by different physical laws and it is not convenient to deal with this as a single, it is normal to separate tire, aerodynamic and gravitational force components act at different locations and in different directions relative to the vehicle chassis.

In order to calculate accelerations and velocities in directions of interest (such as fore and aft for performance and/or left or right for turning behaviour), it is necessary to define axis systems to which the accelerations and velocities and the forces/torques causing them can be referred.

## Two types of Axis System
The two basic axis systems used and defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) are described in the following sections.

### Earth-Fixed Axis System
This system (the capital letter system) is fixed to the ground and the letters X-Y-Z are used to denote the three principal directions; **X and Y are horizontal and at right angles to each other, Z is vertical downward.**

<u>Note</u>: This earth-referenced axis system is used in this text only when it is necessary to reference some aspect of the vehicle motion to a fixed point or direction. 

In problems related to vehicle motion relative to the ground, it is common to start off with the origin of the vehicle axis system (described below), coinciding with the earth axis system origin. Frequently, the axes of the two systems will also coincide initially. The calculation or measurements will then indicate the relative motions of the two axis systems.


### Vehicle Axis System
The Vehicle Axis System has it origin in aircraft usage. The principal reason for its automotive as well as aircraft use is that it is _fixed_ in the vehicle and moves with it.
The inertia properties (moments and products of inertia) remain constant relative to this set of axes but would be variable if referenced to a set of axes fixed to the ground, for example. Not only would they be variable but they would lose in physical meaning to the engineer as the vehicle maneuvered. 

<u>Note</u>: Some confusion may arise because this axis system is referred to in different ways. Quite commonly it is called a "Moving Axis System" because it moves with the vehicle; it is also labelled as "Body Axes" because it is fixed in the vehicle; frequently it is referred to as the "Stability Axes" or "Directional Control Axis System".

**The point to remember is that it is fixed to the vehicle and the inertia properties relative to it are taken as constant.**

The next question is: where is the origin of this axis system located and how are the axes oriented in the vehicle? The automobile is considered as a two-mass system. 
The _unsprung_ mass is taken as a rigid frame (with steerable wheels) and the _sprung_ mass is considered as a rigid body.
These two masses are "hinged" together at the roll axis and one variable, roll angle, specifies the relationship between the two masses.

The figure below shows these respective masses and how they are brought together in the complete car.
Axes $i_s$ and $i_u$ come together in the complete car as $i$; similarly $j_s$ and $j_u$ converge to $j$, and $k_s$ and $k_u$ to $k$.

![][axis_system_used_in_determination_of_the_vehicle_axis_system.png]

Axes $i, j$, and $k$ are relabelled as x, y and z (lower case) in the SAE system shown in the figure below. The system is orthogonal and is right-handed.
The x-axis is horizontal and positive forward in the direction of motion when the vehicle is traveling in a straight line on a level road (road is assumed flat).
The x-axis lies in the longitudinal plane of symmetry (with the vehicle assumed to have left-right symmetry). The y-axis points to the driver's right, is horizontal and 90° to the x-axis. The z-axis is perpendicular to the other two, is vertical and positive downward.

![][vehicle_axis_system.png]

<u>Note</u>: **Important thing to note is that the origin of the vehicle axis system (x, y, z) is the same for the sprung and unsprung masses**, as indicated in the figure above.

The origin,, is located at the intersection of the vehicle roll axis and a line perpendicular to the road through the CG of the total vehicle, for a zero roll angle of the sprung mass. It is usually assumed that the sprung mass rolls about the horizontal x-axis, rather than about the actual roll axis.

<u>Note</u>: Tire deflections are neglected and the plane of the wheel centers (with equal sized wheels front and rear) remains parallel to the ground.

## Vehicle Motions
In vehicle dynamics studies of a vehicle motion, it is customary for the user to fix certain operating variables. Therefore a value can be assigned to the forward velocity and the tractive/braking force or longitudinal acceleration/deceleration.
The motion of the unsprung mass can then be studied as a _perturbation_ from the steady velocity condition; likewise the roll of the sprung mas can be studied in relation to the unsprung mass.

For vehicle stability and control investigations the perturbation velocities of interest are:
- forward velocity, $u$
- lateral velocity, $v$
- yawing velocity, $r$
- rolling velocity, $p$

<u>Note</u>: For stability and control investigation, the pitch and vertical perturbations ($q$ and $w$) are neglected.

Since these perturbation velocity components (linear and angular) about the vehicle-fixed axes must be measured relative to a reference, and because an actual path along the ground is desired, we adopt the convention of referencing the Vehicle Axis System to the Earth-Fixed Axis System as the initial condition.

The various acceleration components (rates of change of the velocity components perturbations) are defined below along with the angular relationships associated with path analysis (shown in the figure below):
-  **Longitudinal Acceleration** is the component of the vector acceleration of a point in the vehicle in the x-direction.
- **Side Acceleration** is the component of the vector acceleration of a point in the vehicle in the y-direction.
- **Normal Acceleration** is the component of the vector acceleration of a point in the vehicle in the z-direction.
- **Lateral Acceleration** is the component of the vector acceleration of a point in the vehicle perpendicular to the vehicle x-axis and parallel to the road plane.
  
  <u>Note</u>: In steady state condition, _lateral acceleration_ is equal to the product of _centripetal acceleration_ times the cosine of the vehicle's _sideslip angle_. Since in most test conditions the _sideslip angle_ is small, for practical purposes the _lateral acceleration_ can be considered equal to the _centripetal acceleration_.

- **Centripetal Acceleration** is the component of the vector acceleration of a point in the vehicle perpendicular to the tangent to the path of that point and parallel to the road plane.
-  **Heading Angle** ($\Psi$) is the angle between the trace on the X-Y plane of the vehicle x-axis and the X-axis of the earth-fixed axis system (see figure below).
- **Sideslip angle** (Attitude Ange, $\beta$) is the angle between the traces on the X-Y plane of the vehicle x-axis and the vehicle velocity vector at some specified point in the vehicle.
- **Course Angle** ($v$) is the angle between the trace of the vehicle velocity vector in the X-Y plane and X-axis of the earth-fixed system. A positive course angle is shown in the figure below.
  
  <u>Note</u>: Course angle is the sum of _heading angle_ and _sideslip angle_ ($v = \psi + \beta$)

- **Vehicle Roll Angle** is the angle between the vehicle y-axis and the ground plane.
- **Vehicle Pitch Angle** is the angle between the vehicle x-axis and the ground plane. 

The force/moment components are defined below:
_Forces_ - The external forces acting on the automobile can be summed into one force vector having the following components.

- **Longitudinal Force** ($F_x$) is the component of the force vector in the x-direction.
- **Side Force** ($F_y$) is the component of the force vector in the y-direction.
- **Normal Force** ($F_z$) is the component of the force vector in the z-direction.

_Moments_ - The external moments acting on the automobile can be summed into one moment vector having the following components.

- **Rolling Moment** ($M_z$) is the component of the moment vector tending to rotate the vehicle about the x-axis, positive locking clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the x-axis.
- **Pitching Moment** ($M_y$) is the component of the moment vector tending to rotate the vehicle about the y-axis, positive clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the y-axis.
- **Yawing Moment** ($M_z$) is the component of the moment vector tending to rotate the vehicle about the z-axis, positive clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the z-axis.

## Some thoughts on sign conventions
In the SAE Tire Axis System, the slip angle is defined as the angle between the wheel plane and the direction of wheel travel. _In this system, if the wheel is moving forward to the left (as in a right-hand turn), the slip angle is negative but the lateral force is positive_. 
Following this convention, the tire lateral force data is plotted in the fourth quadrant. In actual practice, users of tire data frequently plot cornering force in the first quadrant. This negative relationship between lateral force and slip angle can be confusing in the kinematic relationship between slip and steer angles.

<u>Note</u>: The term "slip angle" is a questionable one since the wheel is not actually slipping laterally but rather is operating in a yawned-rolling condition. 

**Defining "slip angle" in terms of a lateral/forward velocity ratio further perpetuates the notion that the tire is literally sliding sideways as a whole.**
In actual fact, because of the tire rolling motion, the print has areas composed of adhesion in the front and sliding in the rear.

# Simplified Steady-State Stability and Control
In order to obtain a mental framework for understanding vehicle behaviour we consider vehicle motions as composed of steady-state turning (this chapter) and dynamic (transient) maneuvering (next chapter). 

**In the past and even today the terms understeer and oversteer have dominated considerations of automotive stability and control. It is one factor among a number that determine automobile motion behaviour.**

One of the basic design requirements of a race car is the provision of control and stability characteristics that enable a skilled driver to operate at or near the g-g acceleration limits. 
As the above requirement indicates, in real life the vehicle behaviour and the driver's capabilities are inseparably connected. The driver provides the intelligence to the "driver-vehicle" entity while the vehicle provides the maneuvering forces. The figure below illustrates this relationship in a generalized "block" diagram.

![][block_diagram_driver_vehicle.png]

Because of the difficulty of representing the driver in an analysis and because the driver's characteristics are not subject to direct control, the engineer focuses on the control and stability of the vehicle component part of the system.
In fact, as it can be seen, for simplicity purposes, the throttle, brake and any other control devices have been omitted from the graph.

A concept which is helpful in approaching a subject as difficult as automobile stability and control is the "ladder of abstraction" sketched below:

![][ladder_of_abstraction.png]

The term complete reality at the top is the functioning car, say as the race driver experiences it, not what the driver may care to think about it. As we move down to the ladder we move away from physical car and make simplifying assumptions as to how it works.

_The approach followed here is to start near the bottom of the ladder with an extremely simplified vehicle model. If the basic concepts can be clarified at a simple level they will carry through to a more realistic level._

## The Elementary Automobile Defined
This representation of the automobile (often referred to as the "bicycle" model) is defined as follows:
- _No_ lateral load transfer, the vehicle compressed to a single-track.
- _No_ longitudinal load transfer.
- _No_ rolling or pitching motions.
- Linear range tires.
- Constant forward velocity (chosen by the user).
- _No_ aerodynamic effects.
- Position control
- _No_ chassis or suspension compliance effects.

As noted in the list above, the tire cornering force curve (lateral force vs. slip angle) is treated as having linear, transitional, and frictional (breakaway) regions.
The race car operates in all of these regions, in particular in the transitional and frictional regions during cornering. For this simple model, tire operation is in the linear regime only, corresponding to cornering at less than about 0.4g.

It is also further assumed that the "vehicle" operates on smooth surfaces with no ride motions. We will also use the small angle assumptions to simplify the equations unless otherwise noted.

<u>Note</u>: With this simple vehicle model, shown in the figure below, we can investigate the effects of front and rear tire cornering stiffness, center of gravity (CoG) location along the wheel base, and geometric steer angle on the yawing and sideslipping motions (which determine the path and attitude of the vehicle).

![][the_bicycle_model.png]

**For this representation of the vehicle, the two "degrees of freedom" are the motion variables, $v$ (the lateral velocity) and $r$ (the yawing velocity). The input variable is the front wheel steer angle, $\delta$, which is under driver control.**

When an automobile makes a turn it normally goes through three phases. The first is the turn entry, for example from a straight. In this phase the yawing velocity and the lateral velocity (relative to the vehicle y-axis as shown in the figure above) build up from zero in straight running to their values in the steady turn. This is called the "_transient turn-entry_" phase where $r$ and $v$ are changing with time. The second phase is "_steady-state cornering_" $r$ and $v$ and the vehicle and tire slip angles are constant and the vehicle is moving along an unvarying path radius, $R$ (or path curvature defined as $1/R$). The final phase is "_turn exit_", where the yawing and lateral velocities are changing with time as they return to zero for straight running, "_transient turn-exit_".

## Steady-State Low-Speed Cornering Geometry
We begin by considering the **geometry** of very low-speed cornering in the steady-state phase only. 

<u>Note</u>: Under these conditions where fore and aft and lateral accelerations are negligible, real vehicles behave like the previously defined "bicycle" model in that **there is no body roll, lateral load transfer or related effects**. 
**The slip angles are zero and the front and rear wheels roll in their own planes so that turning is purely a geometric proposition**. The front and rear wheels move on concentric circles, the front wheels are on the larger circle as shown in the figure below.

The **radius of turn** is normally taken _as the distance from the turning center to the center of gravity (CoG) of the vehicle_. For normal turns the small angle approximation, $l/R$, is close to the required steering angle, $\delta$ (in radians).
As the wheelbase, $l$, is increased, the steering angle increases in proportion for a constant turning radius.

The wheelbase angle also known as "_Ackermann Steering Angle_" is then the geometric steer angle required for a car of wheelbase, $l$, to track a turn of radius, $R$, at low speeds **where the external forces due to accelerations are negligible**.

The Ackermann Steering Angle is not to be confused with so-called "_Ackermann steering_" where the left- and right-hand front wheels are set up to give theoretically perfect steering at low speeds by being tangent to concentric circles about a turning center which lies on a line through the rear axle.
The Classic Ackermann configuration for steering is shown in the figure below and results in "_toe out_" of the outside wheel in a turn. Race cars have frequently used "_reverse Ackermann angle_".

![][ackermann_parallel_and_reverse_ackermann.png]

## Steady-State Cornering of the Neutral Steer Car.
The engineering definitions of neutral, understeer and oversteer can be developed with the bicycle model. 
Consider what happens with the "bicycle" model when the cornering speed is increased such that the lateral acceleration can no longer be neglected.
*The centripetal acceleration, $V^2 /R$, acts inward toward the turning center. The lateral force provided by the tires and has a magnitude of $(W/g) \cdot (V^2/R) = ma$*, in accordance with Newton's second law. Another way of treating this dynamic situation is to represent the presence of the acceleration by a hypothetical external force equal to $-ma$. The system is then brought into equilibrium and treated as a static condition. The external force is called the _centrifugal inertia force_. 

Several interesting observations can be made from a comparison of the figure below and the "_Ackerman steering angle_" (a) graph:

![][turning_with_lateral_forces.png]

- The same steer angle is required to negotiate the same radius curve regardless of speed.
- The vehicle slip angle is obtained by rotating the entire vehicle by the amount $\alpha_R$ (since in this simple model the plane of the rear wheel is always parallel to the chassis fore and aft centerline). This rotation establishes the _attitude_ of the machine to its path. This angle, $\beta$, is normally measured between the chassis centerline at the CoG and the tangent to the path. $\beta$ is called the _vehicle slip angle_ or _body slip angle_.
- In the situation shown the rear wheels are travelling on a smaller radius (R) than the fronts.
- _The rotation that gives rise to the rear slip angle also steers the front wheels - in this case the front slip angle is the same as the rear_.

To emphasize the last point, for the vehicle configuration chosen in this example (CoG at mid-wheelbase and equal tire cornering stiffnesses front and rear), the slip angle required at the front to produce the force and moment equilibrium is obtained entirely from the rotation of the vehicle during the establishment of the rear slip angle. With this configuration, the steer angle, $\delta$, is completely determined by the path curvature independents of the speed or lateral acceleration developed. In short, the steering angle remains at the Ackermann, $\delta = l/R$.

**The vehicle configuration under discussion is termed _neutral steer_ (NS) because as lateral acceleration (side force) is applied to the machine, it neither "oversteers" nor "understeers" the intended geometric path established by the Ackermann Steering Angle.

Let's examine now the NS car behaviour *under an external disturbance*.
Suppose that the vehicle is traveling down a straight and level road with zero steering angle. Let us assume that it then runs onto a stretch of uniformly tilted road. If no change is made to the steering angle, one can expect that after the transient phase is over, the vehicle will be running on a straight line angled down the slope by the magnitude of the equal front and rear slip angles.
_The heading of the vehicle_ (in this case the angle between the chassis and the road centerline) _will remain zero_.

Where, the angle of the path in the plane of the road is:

$\alpha_F = \alpha_R = \left( \frac{1}{C_F} \right) \left( \frac{W_\phi}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{C_R} \right) \left( \frac{W_\phi}{2} \right)$ 

The figure below shows the example stated and described above.

![][ns_car_on_a_tilted_road.png]

## Steady-State Cornering of the Understeer Car
Consider now the simple "bicycle" model with the center of gravity located at 1/3 of the wheelbase aft (number with no significance other than it places the CoG well ahead of the mid-wheelbase point) of the front track.

The static load on the front wheels is now 2/3 W and that on the rear is 1/3 W; the front wheels are carrying twice the load of the rear. Also assume that, by changes in tire sizes and pressures the cornering slopes are equalized front and rear at the same numerical value utilized in the NS example, then with the same wheelbase, the Ackermann Steering Angle for a given path curvature is the same as for the NS model. 

What happens as the cornering speed is increased, and the vehicle experiences a centrifugal side force?

The vehicle acts as a horizontal beam or lever. The side force must be reacted at the individual tracks in inverse proportion to the CoG to track distance (in ratio to the wheel-base). Therefore, the front track takes 2/3 of the cornering force and the rear the remaining 1/3.
In addition, since the cornering stiffnesses are identical front and rear, the slip angle at the front must be twice that on the rear, so $\alpha_F / \alpha_R = 2$.

Figure below shows the case when the turn radius, $R_1$, is made equal to that of the NS configuration. In these circumstances, the vehicle attitude angle, $\beta$, is less by the reduction in the rear slip angle; the front slip angle that arises from this rotation is correspondingly less.

![][turning_with_lateral_forces_us_car.png]

In short, **the steering angle required to maintain the specified radius is $(2/3)\alpha_1$ more than for the NS car, and it is compensated by adding more steering angle**. This increase arises from the difference between the front and rear slip angles - the Ackermann has remained unchanged (same $l$ and $R$). _It can be said that, as far as vehicle knows, slip angles are merely steer angles_.

For complex real vehicles additional steer effects must be taken into account as well as the slip angle difference due to the CoG location. In general most of the effects which change the slip angles are proportional to lateral acceleration, for example, roll steers and compliance (deflection) steers.

The important point to note is that at the same lateral acceleration and steer angle the turn radius of the forward CoG machine is greater than that of the NS vehicle. **The forward CoG machine is termed _understeer_ (US) - as a lateral acceleration is applied it "understeers" the geometric path established by the Ackermann Steering Angle**. 

For reasons of clarity we have discussed US in terms of the longitudinal CoG location with equal cornering stiffness F and R. **This may be generalized by pointing out that any modifications which affect the rate of change of the front and rear slip angles with lateral acceleration will change the steady-state UO (under/oversteer) properties of the vehicle**. 
_The slopes can be affected by a large number of design factors including tire size and pressure, roll and compliance steers, camber effects, longitudinal and lateral load transfer, aerodynamic loading, and others_.

## Steady-State Cornering of the Oversteer Car
We have now examined the steering properties of NS and US cars due to front and rear slip angle changes under side forces (such as lateral acceleration). 

<u>Note</u>: As a reminder, on the neutral steer car the rates of change of $\alpha_F$ and $\alpha_R$ with the lateral acceleration $A_Y$ are identical and the car corners on the geometric Ackermann Steering Angle. On the understeer car, on the other hand, the rate of change of $\alpha_F$ with $A_Y$ exceeded that of $\alpha_R$ with $A_Y$ and either the path radius, $R$, increased with lateral acceleration or more steer angle was required to hold the radius.

**It is then easy to anticipate the steering behaviour of the _oversteer_ (OS) car. In this machine the rate of change of rear slip angle with $A_Y$ (lateral acceleration) is greater than the rate of change of the front slip angle; the slip angle steer at the rear predominates and the car "oversteers" the intended geometrical path established by the Ackermann Steering Angle.
